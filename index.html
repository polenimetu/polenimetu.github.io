The Development of Technology Has Created More Problems Than Offered Solutions <br><br>
 
Technology has been part of our lives from start, whether it was when we invented the wheel or bought the latest iPhone. People are thinking often about technology as the latest IT-devices, not as everything that surrounds us. Statement in the heading can be understood both ways, though not both may not be true.
First, what has been a goal for technology? Obviously, it has always been to make our lives better and it is simple to prove that with a question. Would we have bought or used it if it were not? The answer here is simple, no, though problems might come when we exploit it and that is our fault, not the technologies itself. It is cruel to blame tech when we made the mistakes and want to cover up them with blaming something else. 
Why do we want to blame tech for our own mistakes? It is often cased in researches and documentaries that the villain in the story is the software or technology. As far as artificial intelligence has not taken control of our world, we cannot really blame anyone or thing else than the maker of those products or ourselves because those products are made by humans for humans.
Technology has always been the tool, not the source. Source has been us. If technology has made problems, then the problem is in us as using it wrong and denying it will trap us into our own lies.<br><br>
